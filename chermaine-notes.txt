git status
	tells us the status of our working directory
	red = changes are in cardboard box
	green = changes are in wooden box
	
	workign tree clean = changes are in repository (metal box)

git add
	tells git to start tracking a file
	(move stuff to the wooden box)

git commit -m "message"
	commit changes to the repository
	(move stuff from wooden box to metal box)   

git log

git log --oneline
	shows us all the commits in oneline

Basic git workflow:

We have committed twice. = We made changes twice.
We made two commits. = We made two changes.
