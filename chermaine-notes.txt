	red = changes are in cardboard box
	green = changes are in wooden box
	
	working tree clean = changes are in repository (metal box)

git add
	tells git to start tracking a file
	(move stuff to the wooden box)

git commit -m "message"
	commit changes to the repository
	(move stuff from wooden box to metal box)   

git log
