basic git workflow:

========================

after commiting should see "working tree clean nothing to commit"
(everything you have now is in repository)

git log shows from newest to oldest (top to bot)
git checkout [identification no. of the commit]: allows you to go back to the first commit in history

git checkout master: goes to the latest version 
========================

collab aspect of git:
